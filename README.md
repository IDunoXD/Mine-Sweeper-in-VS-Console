# Mine-Sweeper-in-VS-Console
lil game i made for the task in university

It has some differences from regular microsoft mine sweeper, but also a feature, the one to solve situations where you have to choose blindfully one of two spots where mine can be. In my game you can put flag on one of these two spots and still win. But it doesn't mean that you can cover whole map with flags and win, this won't work.
